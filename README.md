I'm a Web Developer focused on frontend development.

I mainly work with JavaScript. Vue.js and Inertia.js are my daily bread, and I recently started studying React and its ecosystem.
I also have a basic understanding of PHP and its framework Laravel, which I initially studied at the Hackademy bootcamp by [Aulab](https://aulab.it/), while continuing to deepen thanks to [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/@Andros).

I migrated some of my repositories from my [GitLab account](https://gitlab.com/andrea-dam), so if you like to access all my work, be sure to check it out! I fully moved on GitHub though, so all my future work will be here.
